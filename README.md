# Catan: The Stack

## Page House Ditch Day 2025

### Overview

Catan: The Stack is a web-based resource management game inspired by the board game Settlers of Catan. Throughout Ditch Day, teams will complete challenges to earn resources and development cards, which they'll manage through this application. The team with the most points at the end of the day wins!

### Game Mechanics

#### Resources

There are four types of resources:
- Grain
- Wool
- Brick
- Lumber

Resources are publicly visible to all teams. The goal is to collect sets of resources that can be converted to victory points.

#### Development Cards

Development cards are hidden from other teams and provide special abilities:

1. **Robber Card** - Steal a random resource from a team of your choice
2. **Choose 2 Resources Card** - Receive 2 resource cards of your choice (can be the same resource or different)
3. **Victory Point Card** - Worth 1 point at the end of the game (hidden from other teams)

#### Scoring

Points are calculated using the following formula:
- 1 Grain + 1 Wool + 1 Brick + 1 Lumber = 1 Victory Point
- No partial victory points are allowed (you need exactly one of each resource type)
- Victory Point cards are added to your score at the end of the game

**Strategy Tip:** Keep your resources as evenly spread as possible to maximize your points!

### How to Play

#### For Teams

1. **Log in** using your team credentials
2. **View Resources** - See your team's and other teams' resource counts
3. **Trade Resources** - Propose trades with other teams
4. **Use Development Cards**:
   - Use the Robber card to steal a resource from another team
   - Use the Choose 2 Resources card to get resources of your choice
   - Hold onto Victory Point cards until the end of the game
5. **Complete Challenges** - Earn resources and development cards by completing challenges throughout the day

#### For Seniors

Seniors administrate the game by:
1. **Starting/Ending the Game** - Control when the game begins and ends
2. **Assigning Resources** - Award resources to teams as they complete challenges
3. **Assigning Development Cards** - Give teams development cards as rewards
4. **Monitoring Game State** - View all teams' hands and progress

### Trading

Teams can propose trades with each other through the application. Both parties must accept a trade for it to be completed. Be strategic with your trades to maximize your point potential!

### Winning the Game

At the end of Ditch Day, the senior team will end the game, and points will be tallied automatically. The team with the highest combined score from resource sets and Victory Point cards wins!

Remember that other teams may have hidden Victory Point cards, so the visible scoreboard might not tell the complete story!
